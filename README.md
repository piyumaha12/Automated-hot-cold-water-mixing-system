# Automated hot-cold water mixing system ðŸš¿ðŸ›€ 


The automated hot-cold water mixing system is designed for domastic purpose in bathroom domain. 

There are many fetal accidents because of getting exposed to hot water used for bathing purpose,especially in case of solar heaters. This system insure the proper mixing ratio of hot and cold water, so that the user will be safe and also it will save time and you can enjoy hot water bathing without worrying.

### This project can be divided into sub parts like:
1. Ordering components.
2. Programming
3. PCB Designning and Etching
4. Soldering all elements.
5. Creating pipeline network with solenoid valve.
6. Assembling all component and testing.

## Ordering Components:
The components required for this project are ordered from Surat and from website https://www.electronicscomp.com/
The extensive list of components required for this project are given in []

## Programming

The Programming language in C++ and C# for arduino. The prgramms are created in batches, so i can test individual components and then i combined those small programms into large and final one.
