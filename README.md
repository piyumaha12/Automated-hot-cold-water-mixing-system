# Automated hot-cold water mixing system ðŸš¿ðŸ›€ 


The automated hot-cold water mixing system is designed for domastic purpose in bathroom domain. 

There are many fetal accidents because of getting exposed to hot water used for bathing purpose,especially in case of solar heaters. This system insure the proper mixing ratio of hot and cold water, so that the user will be safe and also it will save time and you can enjoy hot water bathing without worrying.
